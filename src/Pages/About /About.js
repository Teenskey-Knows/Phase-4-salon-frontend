             The --rebase option can be used to ensure a linear history by preventing unnecessary merge commits. Many developers prefer rebasing over merging, since itâ€™s like saying, "I want to put my changes on top of what everybody else has done." In this sense, using git pull with the --rebase flag is even more like svn update than a plain git pull.

In fact, pulling with --rebase is such a common workflow that there is a dedicated configuration option for it:
             </p>
        </div>
       
    )
}

export default About;
